## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1.Ensure you have the SDL2 library installed on your system.
2.Clone this repository:
3.git clone https://github.com/Ndivhuwo26/The-Maze.git
4.cd maze-game
5.Compile the game:
6.gcc main.c functions.c -o maze_game -lSDL2 -lm

#Usage

Run the game with a map file:
./maze_game path/to/map_file.txt

Replace path/to/map_file.txt with the path to your map file.

#Controls

W: Move forward
S: Move backwards
A: Strafe left
D: Strafe right
Left Arrow: Rotate camera left
Right Arrow: Rotate camera right
M: Toggle mini-map display

#Map File Format

Create custom maps using the following format:

Use '1' for walls
Use '0' for empty spaces
Use '2' for enemy
Ensure the map is rectangular
Include at least one valid path through the maze

#Example: map_with_enemies.txt

#Tech Stack

Programming Language:

C: The core language for developing the game, utilizing its performance and low-level capabilities for graphics and game logic.
Game Development Library:

SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer): Used for graphics rendering, handling window creation, input management, and audio. SDL2 is a popular choice for 2D games due to its cross-platform capabilities.
Development Tools:

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): The compiler used for building your C project.
Make: A build automation tool to manage the compilation of your project.
Version Control:

Git: For version control to track changes in your project and collaborate with others.
Text Editor/IDE:

Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion: Any of these IDEs can be used for writing and managing your C code efficiently.
Graphics and Design:

Tiled Map Editor (optional): If you decide to use more complex maps, Tiled can help design and export tile-based maps.
Image Editing Software (optional): Tools like GIMP or Adobe Photoshop for creating or editing game graphics, textures, and sprites.
Documentation:

Markdown: For writing your README.md and any project documentation.
Future Considerations:
Game Engines: If you decide to expand the project or create more complex features in the future, you might consider learning a game engine like Unity (using C#) or Godot (using GDScript).
Networking: If you plan to add multiplayer features, you could look into libraries like ENet for network communication.
